### Adding Wordlists
1. Create or download a wordlist .txt file where every word is seperated by a newline
2. Drop the wordlist .txt file into the wordlists folder

### Using Proxies (Only supports using one proxy address, so it's best to use a rotating proxy)
1. Enter the "config" folder and open config.json in a text editor or notepad
2. Replace the '"proxy": false' with:
               "proxy": {"username": "Your Proxy Username", "password": "Your Proxy Password", "ip": "Proxy IP:Port"}
4. Save the file
